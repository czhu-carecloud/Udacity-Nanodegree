###Boston Housing:
https://github.com/czhu6515/Udacity-Nanodegree/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb

Basic statiscal analysis of housing data from boston from housing data collected in 1978. Used a decision-tree regressor along with depth analysis, grid search, and k-fold cross-validation to find the best model to predict housing prices.

###Finding Donors:
https://github.com/czhu6515/Udacity-Nanodegree/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb

Projected income of individuals using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Performed analysis of data using Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest classifier and determined best performing algorithm using fbeta_score and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics. RFC turned out to be not only the best performing predictively, but also required less training time. Future explored dataset based on feature importance and tuned RFC's performance with grid search

###Customer Segments:
https://github.com/czhu6515/Udacity-Nanodegree/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb

Performed feature exploration to describe the variation of different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with to equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. Scaled data and removed outliers and used pricipal component analysis and dimensionality reduction to determine most important features. Lastly, used k-means clustering to determine customer segmenets.

###Student Intervention System
https://github.com/czhu6515/Udacity-Nanodegree/blob/master/student_intervention/student_intervention.ipynb

Used SVMs, GNB, and RFCs to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate.
